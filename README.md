## 📦 Food Ordering App (Python)

This project was built as part of an exam in my Python training program. It simulates a simple food ordering system where users can select items from a menu, input quantities, and receive a receipt.

The logic was written by me, and the test cases were provided as part of the assessment to validate the code.

### ✅ Features

- Menu display for 3 food items  
- User input with error handling  
- Order tracking for multiple items and quantities  
- Dynamic receipt generation  
- Automated test coverage using `unittest` and `unittest.mock`
